# BDNK frame constraints

The BDNK formalism [1] defines a relativistic viscous fluid theory which has been rigorously proven to be causal, (linearly) stable about thermodynamic equilibrium, strongly hyperbolic, and consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, provided one chooses a *hydrodynamic frame* (set of transport coefficients) satisfying two sets of nonlinear inequalities.  In the Mathematica 13 document **BDNK_frame_constraints.nb**, we confirm that the class of hydrodynamic frames provided in [2] satisfies the BDNK constraints.  The notebook is written so that it can be modified to construct new hydrodynamic frames, possibly for systems with alternative microphysics (the case considered uses the ideal gas "gamma-law" equation of state); if you use the notebook, please cite [2].
